# <h1 align = 'center'> Brain-cancer-detection </h1>
# Introduction
Brain cancer is a devastating disease that affects millions of people worldwide. In recent years, deep learning techniques have shown great promise in accurately diagnosing brain tumors from medical images such as MRI scans. In this project, we aim to build a brain cancer detection model using a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Tensorflow and Keras. The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains MRI images along with their corresponding image descriptions and other relevant data.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a CNN model that can accurately diagnose brain cancer from MRI images. By leveraging deep learning techniques, we hope to achieve higher accuracy rates than traditional machine learning approaches. Ultimately, our goal is to create a tool that can assist medical professionals in making faster and more accurate diagnoses, potentially improving patient outcomes and quality of life.
